        224 Colle St, Luxemburg, WI 54217 (United States),<br>
        <a href="mailto:contact@leaguehero.io" target="_blank">contact@leaguehero.io</a></p>
        <p>The data controller does not own the database and the data directly provided by the League User. Therefore, the League user is and will remain the sole owner of the dataset provided.</p>
        <p>However, the data controller owns and may share, without the user's previous consent, some aggregate data (i.e. data generated by the interaction by users with the platform, as well as insights generated over the shared data and the outcome of any analysis process created over the data set) that will be used for statistical purposes only and in such a way as to make the personal identification of the user impossible.</p>
        <h2>Types of Data Collected</h2>
        <p>Among the types of personal data that League Hero collects, by itself or through third parties, there are: first name, last name, phone number, email address, password, cookie, usage data, geographic position and various types of data.</p>
        <p>Other personal data collected may be described in other sections of this privacy policy or by dedicated explanation text contextually with the data collection.</p>
        <p>The personal data may be freely provided by the user, or collected automatically when using League Hero.</p>
        <p>Any use of cookies - or of other tracking tools - by League Hero or by the owners of third party services used by League Hero, unless stated otherwise, serves to identify users and remember their preferences, for the sole purpose of providing the service required by the user.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide certain personal data may make it impossible for League Hero to provide its services.</p>
        <p>Users are responsible for any personal data of third parties obtained, published or shared through League Hero and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the data to League Hero.</p>

        <p>The data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the data controller, in some cases, the data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of the site (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the data controller. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the data controller at any time.</p>
        <h3>Place</h3>

        <h2>The Use of the Collected Data</h2>
        <p>The data controller may provide access to, or otherwise disclose, the data to its commercial partners for the sole purpose of fulfilling its contractual obligations to the user and/or for promotion purposes in case of a pre-determined sponsorship model for the user (i.e. any league who is on a sponsorship supported plan).</p>
        <p>It is worth pointing out that the data controller does not allow competitive crossing (i.e. promoting a competitive league over another one etc.).</p>
        <p>The data controller encourages its commercial partners to use the utmost transparency and adopt severe control measures for privacy protection purposes.</p>
        <p>However, although the data controller might share the data exclusively for the purposes outlined above, their further processing and usage is carried out according to the aforementioned third parties' privacy policies, over which the data controller does not exercise any control and which the user is invited to consult.</p>
        <p>The data concerning the user is collected to allow League Hero to provide its services, as well as for the following purposes: registration and authentication, analytics, hosting and backend infrastructure, Infrastructure monitoring, location-based interactions, contacting the user, user database management and social features.</p>
        <p>Data generated by the users interactions with the platform, as well as insights generated over the shared data and any analysis process created over the data set are property of the data controller.</p>
